# farewell (Farewell Letter Generator)

My last project at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com). This generates employee farewell letters, which is a genre I've always wanted to automate. A lot of the inspiration for the text came from these templates:

  * http://www.sample-resignation-letters.com/p381618-how-to-write-a-farewell-letter.cfm
  * http://career.guru99.com/sample-employee-email-farewell-message/
  * http://careerbright.com/career-self-help/sample-goodbye-emails-to-colleagues
  * http://best-letter.blogspot.com/2013/05/farewell-letter-to-coworkers.html
  * http://jobsearch.about.com/od/goodbyeletters/a/farewellmessage.htm

The first and last names come from Trevor Gerhardt's [names](https://github.com/trevorgerhardt/names/) repo. Random words are sourced from [Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/words/getRandomWords_get_3), and the song lyrics come from the [LYRICSnMUSIC API](http://api.lyricsnmusic.com/api).
